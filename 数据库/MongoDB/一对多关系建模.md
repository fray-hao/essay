##  One-to-Few
嵌入式文档
```
{
  name: 'Kate Monster',
  ssn: '123-456-7890',
  addresses : [
     { street: '123 Sesame St', city: 'Anytown', cc: 'USA' },
     { street: '123 Avenue Q', city: 'New York', cc: 'USA' }
  ]
}
```
- 优点：you don’t have to perform a separate query to get the embedded details
- 缺点：you have no way of accessing the embedded details as stand-alone entities

## One-to-Many

采用引用方式来建模。

零部件：
```
{
    _id : ObjectID('AAAA'),
    partno : '123-aff-456',
    name : '#4 grommet',
    qty: 94,
    cost: 0.94,
    price: 3.99
}
```
产品：
```
{
    name : 'left-handed smoke shifter',
    manufacturer : 'Acme Corp',
    catalog_number: 1234,
    parts : [     // array of references to Part documents
        ObjectID('AAAA'),    // reference to the #4 grommet above
        ObjectID('F17C'),    // reference to a different Part
        ObjectID('D2AA'),
        // etc
    ]
}    
```
## One-to-Squillions
采用parent-referencing

hosts:
```
{
    _id : ObjectID('AAAB'),
    name : 'goofy.example.com',
    ipaddr : '127.66.66.66'
}
```

日志：
```
{
    time : ISODate("2014-03-28T09:42:41.382Z"),
    message : 'cpu is on fire!',
    host: ObjectID('AAAB')       // Reference to the Host document
}
```
## 总结（reacap）
So, even at this basic level, there is more to think about when designing a MongoDB schema than when designing a comparable relational schema. You need to consider two factors:

- Will the entities on the “N” side of the One-to-N ever need to stand alone?
- What is the cardinality（基数） of the relationship: is it one-to-few; one-to-many; or one-to-squillions?

Based on these factors, you can pick one of the three basic One-to-N schema designs:

- Embed the N side if the cardinality is one-to-few and there is no need to access the embedded object outside the context of the parent object
- Use an array of references to the N-side objects if the cardinality is one-to-many or if the N-side objects should stand alone for any reasons
- Use a reference to the One-side in the N-side objects if the cardinality is one-to-squillions
