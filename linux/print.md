Teletype terminals had two ways to output data. They could print data on a continuous roll of 8 1/2 inch paper for a human to read , and they could punch data on 1-inch wide paper tape for a machine to read.

Bacause output was printed, it became the custom within Unix to use the word PRINT to describe the outputting  of information. At the time, this made sense because output was, literally, printed on paper.

Now, within Unix documentation, whenever you read about printing data, it almost always refers to displaying data.
