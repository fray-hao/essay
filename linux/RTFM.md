Like many technical words, RTFM started life as an acronym. In the early days of Unix, RTFM stood for "Read the fucking manual" referring ,of course, to the online manual. Today, however, RTFM is not an acronym, but a legitimate world in its own right.

Now, RTFM is a verb, idicating the **idea** that , when you need information or you are working on a problem, you should spend time trying to find what you need on your own before you ask someone elese to help.
