Bloom's Taxonomy was created in 1956 under the leadership of educational psychologist Dr Benjamin Bloom in order to promote higher forms of thinking in education, such as analyzing and evaluating concepts, processes, procedures, and principles, rather than just remembering facts (rote learning). It is most often used when designing educational, training, and learning processes.

## The Three Domains of Learning

The committee identified three domains of educational activities or learning (Bloom, et al. 1956):

- Cognitive: mental skills (knowledge)

- Affective(情感的): growth in feelings or emotional areas (attitude or self)

- Psychomotor（意识运动）: manual or physical skills (skills)
