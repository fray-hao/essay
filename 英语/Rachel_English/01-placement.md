## Relax and lower 
Through teaching , I've learned how tesion affetcts the placement of speech. American English has a very** relaxed throat and neck**.This allows the placement of the voice to be low. I feel it coming from my chest or the base of my neck. 

Relax and open up your neck and throat to let the resonance sink lower

## Jaw relaxation

Instead of using your muscles to hold the jaw open,which can add tension to the face.

Let the jaw drop down using gravity

Think of releasing your jaw from jaw hinge ,rather than forcing the chin down.

## tongue relaxation
From the L to the R to the T, the tongue is very important when it comes to articulation(发音) of all kinds of sounds.
